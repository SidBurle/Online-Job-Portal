# Online-Job-Portal
Project Overview
The Online Job Portal is a dynamic web application designed to connect job seekers with employers. This project was developed using modern web technologies, focusing on creating a user-friendly and responsive interface that simplifies the job search and application process.

Key Features
User Authentication: Implemented secure user authentication using Firebase Authentication, allowing users to sign up, log in, and manage their profiles.

Job Listings: Users can browse job listings, which include detailed information such as job title, company, location, and job description. Job data is dynamically fetched from the Firebase Firestore database.

Job Search and Filtering: Integrated a search functionality that enables users to find jobs based on keywords, location, and job type. Filters help users narrow down their search results to find the most relevant opportunities.

Job Application: Registered users can apply for jobs directly through the platform. The application process includes submitting a resume and cover letter, which are securely stored in Firebase Storage.

Notifications: Utilized Toastify to provide real-time notifications to users, enhancing the user experience by confirming actions such as successful applications, login status, and error messages.

Navigation and Routing: Employed React Router DOM to manage application routing, ensuring smooth navigation between pages like Home, Job Listings, Job Details, and User Profile.

Responsive Design: The UI is built with a responsive design approach, using CSS to ensure compatibility across various devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
